> **The biggest mistake in learning English is memorizing words in isolation.**  
> To truly master vocabulary, you need to see words in context.

**SentenSearch** helps you do exactly that — with over **50,000 real-life example sentences**, it enables you to learn and reinforce **hundreds of thousands of words** naturally and effectively.
